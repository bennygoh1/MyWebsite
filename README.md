# MyWebsite
Website template for my portfolio website.
More information will be given later, basically I made a website to host my portfolio. I made the website from scratch and decided to share the template here.
This is a project I have made by developing a portfolio website by scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and BootStrap.<br>

# More Description
1. I made this website to establish my online identity. In the process, I also wanted to release the template of the website I have worked from scratch over the past few days because it looked kinda cool.
2. Template is different, I went ahead and made my own rendition.
3. Javascript components are added, one such as when you scroll down, the navbar darkens.
4. Another javascript compnent is that you are able to switch the timeline information with a click of a button.
5. All images are made by me using adobe illustrator. I just can't find any good images online so I decided to make my own.

# Programming Languages and Frameworks used
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. Bootstrap

# More background clarity
Not going to bore you with more details, here is a preview of the website template. It looks nice, right?
