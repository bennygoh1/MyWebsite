# MyWebsite
Website template for my portfolio website.
Basically I made a website to host my portfolio. I made the website from scratch and decided to share the template here.<br>
This is a project I have made by developing a portfolio website by scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap.<br>
I drew a topography image using adobe illustrator and added as the webpage's header image so it reflects a minimalistic theme and overall, it looks pretty good for a website.

# More Description
1. I made this website to establish my online identity. In the process, I also wanted to release the template of the website I have worked from scratch over the past few days because it looked kinda cool.
2. Template is different, I went ahead and made my own rendition where you can find my portfolio in my github profile bio.
3. Javascript components are added, one such as when you scroll down, the navbar darkens.
4. Another javascript compnent is that you are able to switch the timeline information with a click of a button.
5. All images are made by me using adobe illustrator. I just can't find any good images online so I decided to make my own.

# Programming Languages and Frameworks used
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. Bootstrap

# How to host?
1. For free webhosting, use 000webhost or github pages to host your website. Refer to https://pages.github.com/
2. Why can't I see your web hosted github repo? I made my own rendition in a private repository and hosted it. This requires a pro+ github account. If you are a student, you can head over to the github education pack website.
3. Use paid hosting, the cheapest option you can pay for is shared hosting. I recommend hostinger, or hostgator where you can host your website and buy your own domain.

# More background clarity
Not going to bore you with more details, here are some previews of the website template. It looks nice, right?
